## Introduction
Mobility Worldwide, located in Magdeburg, is a globally operating corporation specializing in innovation, production, talent promotion, and services in the mobility domain. The Maintenance & Service (MS) department is responsible for the functioning of physical facilities at client sites. This project aims to enhance service delivery quality by optimizing employee assignments based on historical data analysis.

## ER Diagram
The report includes an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that represents the data structure and relationships between service employees, tasks, and clients.

## Task-1: Visualization of Learning Curves
The first task involves visualizing the learning curves of individual employees to show how their efficiency improves over time. Using datasets from MS SAP DWC and tools like BigQuery and Looker Studio, various graphs were created to illustrate this learning process.

- **Query Used**: SQL queries to join datasets and calculate time spent on each task.
- **Visualization Tools**: Google Looker Studio

## Task-2: Evaluation of Team Effectiveness
The second task evaluates the effectiveness of teams, considering factors like distance to client sites and team composition. This involved extracting relevant data, running SQL queries, and visualizing results using Looker Studio.

- **Key Analysis**: Team performance based on average time to complete tasks, impact of distance on performance, and gender-specific team analysis.

## Task-3: Simulation and ML Model
The third task involves developing a machine learning model to predict the best employee or team for new tasks and creating a simulation model using a Flask application.

- **ML Model**: Linear regression model built with BigQuery ML to predict task completion times.
- **Simulation**: Flask application deployed on Google App Engine to generate and assign tasks.

## System Architecture
The project utilizes Google Cloud services including Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and App Engine to manage data, perform analysis, and host applications.
